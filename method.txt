hello, if you're reading this, it's because you don't know how to bypass the new anti-tamper called Pairip, made by Google Play and added by Roblox. But don't worry, there's an easy way to bypass it. Since Google Play created the anti-tamper, it can't be passed outside of the Google Play Store. This means that the Roblox version on the Amazon App Store is unprotected, or i can say, without the anti-tamper.
